    This tower defense game features 3 levels, each of which feature 3 waves. Do your best to complete every wave! <br>
    To purchase a tower, press its tower button and place it using the mouse. To stop placing, press the same tower button again. <br>
    You can select and upgrade towers by clicking on one of your placed towers as long as you are not in purchase mode. <br>
    Note: You can exit the game early using ESC, but doing this will not send your score to the server! <br>
